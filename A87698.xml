            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Eſtates and Degrees of men therein; Whom we exhort, That firſt, and above all things, They apply their thoughts to make peace with God, To take notice of the remaining and renewed tokens of divine diſpleaſure againſt the Land, To tremble at the remembrance of former, and appearances of future judgements, To lament after the Lord, To lye low before the Throne of Grace, To cry mightily to heaven for diſpelling that cloud of ſin which ſeparateth between our God and us, and for turning away that cloud of wrath which hangeth over our heads. There is cauſe to be humbled and to repent, as for all our iniquities, So for the too little aſſiſtance which hath bin given to ſuch as have born the heavieſt burthen, and ſuffered moſt in this Cauſe; And for the too much compliance with, and indulgence to many who have beene active in the late execrable Rebellion. We know that none can reach the perfection of their duety, neither will the Lord reckon with his People according to his Juſtice, but ſpare them who walk in the integritie of their Spirits, as a man ſpareth his own ſon, So that they may rejoyce in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, notwithſtanding of their ſhort-comings, wherein they doe not allow themſelves; But wilfull neglects are juſt grounds of a great controverſie on the Lords part, and of deep humiliation on ours: And we conceive that the failings of many are ſuch, becauſe the Word of the Lord is a burthen unto them; And though they walk in the wayes of their own heart, yet they ſay they ſhall have Peace; We would have none that are thus guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to account light of it, and ſay, <hi>Is it not a little one?</hi> Every du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty whereto we are oblieged in the Covenant, is of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and breaches even in ſmaller things prove inlets unto more grievous revoltings.</p>
            <p>When we conſider how many who were once open oppoſers or ſecret underminers, being received to the Covenant, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines diſaffected to the ends of the ſame; We cannot but think

that we walk in the midſt of ſnares, and that myſteries of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity work amongſt us, which may produce moſt ſad and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable effects, unto the prejudice of our Religion and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Therefore, Becauſe God hath no greater quarrell againſt a Nation then that of a broken Covenant; Let all who fear an Oath, remember the vows of God which are upon them, <hi>Watch and Pray,</hi> and take good heed that they bee not cheated nor charmed into a violation of all, or any of the Articles of that Sacred and Solemn League and Covenant; And let theſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially be obſerved and avoided, who do, or ſhall indevour a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion and breach between the Kingdoms, or the making of any factions or parties contrary to the Covenant, under pretence of preſerving the King and his Authority, whileſt they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and ſincerely proſecute and preſſe our frequent deſires of his ſubſcribing the League and Covenant, and giving ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all things to the juſt deſires of both Kingdomes; Which underhand dealing can prove nothing elſe, but an abuſing of His Majeſty for mens own deſignes: We wiſh that none ſuffer themſelves to be deceived by any falſe gloſſes of the Covenant, under which ſome may poſſibly urge the keeping of it, ſo as to draw us into a certaine breach thereof, and preſſe the defence of the Kings Authority and of Religion, to engage us in thoſe wayes that would tend to the ruine of both: We are not now to preſſe the want of full ſatisfaction in the much deſired work of Uniformity, as the ground of a breach betweene the Nations; Though we ſtill conceive, this Nation will never be wanting to proſecute that worke to the uttermoſt of their power in all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wayes, according to the League and Covenant.</p>
            <p>Theſe Kingdoms, after many fervent Supplications and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full endeavours of all the Lovers of Truth and Peace, have been happily united into a League and Covenant, which to this day hath been kept inviolably, notwithſtanding of all the oppoſition
